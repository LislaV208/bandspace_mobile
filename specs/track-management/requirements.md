# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements track management functionality for the new track-based architecture, replacing the song-based approach. Users need the ability to manage individual tracks (edit, delete) similar to the existing song management functionality, but adapted for the Track model and integrated with the track player system.

The Track model contains basic track information (id, title, createdBy, dates) and references a mainVersion (Version model) which contains the actual audio data (bpm, duration, AudioFile). This hierarchical structure (Track → Version → AudioFile) must be considered in all management operations, as future versions will support multiple versions per track.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a musician, I want to manage tracks in my project, so that I can edit track details and remove unwanted tracks from my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am viewing a track in the track player THEN I SHALL see a "Manage" button that provides track management options
2. WHEN I click the "Manage" button THEN the system SHALL display a bottom sheet with available management actions (Edit Track, Delete Track)
3. WHEN I select "Edit Track" THEN the system SHALL open an edit dialog allowing me to modify track title and BPM (tempo)
4. WHEN I select "Delete Track" THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before permanently removing the track and its associated versions
5. WHEN I confirm track deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the track, its mainVersion, and associated AudioFile from the project
6. WHEN I save track edits THEN the system SHALL update both track-level (title) and version-level (BPM) properties and refresh the display in the track player

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a musician, I want the track management to integrate seamlessly with the track player, so that changes are immediately reflected in the player interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I edit a track THEN the track player SHALL immediately reflect the updated track information
2. WHEN I delete the currently playing track THEN the system SHALL stop playback and navigate to the next available track or return to the project view
3. WHEN track management operations complete THEN the track list in the player SHALL be automatically updated
4. WHEN no tracks remain after deletion THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the empty state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the track management to follow the established architecture patterns, so that the code is maintainable and consistent with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing track management THEN the system SHALL use the BLoC pattern for state management
2. WHEN creating new components THEN they SHALL follow the established naming conventions and file structure
3. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN the implementation SHALL reuse existing UI components (OptionsBottomSheet, dialogs)
4. WHEN handling track operations THEN the system SHALL use the existing repository pattern for data access
5. WHEN managing state THEN the implementation SHALL properly handle loading, success, and error states
6. WHEN working with Track data THEN the system SHALL respect the Track → Version → AudioFile hierarchy
7. WHEN editing tracks THEN the system SHALL modify both track-level properties (title) and version-level properties (BPM) as a unified operation
### Req
uirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly handle the Track-Version-AudioFile relationship in management operations, so that the system maintains data integrity and prepares for future multi-version support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deleting a track THEN the system SHALL cascade delete the mainVersion and its associated AudioFile
2. WHEN editing a track THEN the system SHALL update both track properties (title) and mainVersion properties (BPM) while preserving the relationship structure
3. WHEN displaying track information THEN the system SHALL access audio metadata through track.mainVersion.file properties
4. WHEN the mainVersion is null THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully and disable audio-related operations
5. WHEN preparing for future multi-version support THEN the architecture SHALL allow easy extension to handle multiple versions per track
