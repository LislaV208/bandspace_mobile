# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a centralized error management system for the entire application, replacing scattered error handling logic with a unified, maintainable approach. Currently, error handling is duplicated across multiple components (like TrackErrorHandler) and lacks consistency in user messaging and error classification.

The system needs to provide consistent, user-friendly error messages across the application while maintaining type safety and proper error categorization. It should handle network errors, authentication issues, permission problems, and business logic validation errors in a unified manner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive consistent and clear error messages throughout the application, so that I understand what went wrong and what I can do about it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly message in Polish
2. WHEN a network connectivity issue occurs THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate connection problems
3. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL inform about session expiry and login requirements
4. WHEN a permission error occurs THEN the system SHALL explain the access restrictions clearly
5. WHEN a server error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and suggest retry actions
6. WHEN a validation error occurs THEN the system SHALL show specific field-level validation messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized error handling system, so that I don't have to duplicate error mapping logic across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new features THEN developers SHALL NOT need to create custom error handlers for common error types
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the error transformation SHALL happen automatically at the network layer
3. WHEN displaying errors in UI THEN developers SHALL use a simple `error.toString()` approach
4. WHEN new error types are needed THEN they SHALL extend the existing exception hierarchy
5. WHEN debugging errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error categorization and context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe error handling, so that I can handle specific error types appropriately and catch errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN catching exceptions THEN the system SHALL provide specific exception types for pattern matching
2. WHEN handling authentication errors THEN the system SHALL distinguish between different auth failure types
3. WHEN processing network errors THEN the system SHALL differentiate between timeout, connectivity, and server errors
4. WHEN working with business logic errors THEN the system SHALL provide domain-specific exception types
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN developers SHALL be able to mock specific exception types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error system to integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase, so that migration is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing error handling THEN the new system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
2. WHEN replacing custom error handlers THEN the migration SHALL be incremental and safe
3. WHEN updating cubits THEN the error handling changes SHALL be minimal and consistent
4. WHEN the system is implemented THEN all existing API calls SHALL continue to work without modification
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the behavior SHALL be identical or improved compared to the current implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want error information to be properly categorized and logged, so that I can monitor application health and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly categorized by type and severity
2. WHEN network errors happen THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail level
3. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL be tracked for security monitoring
4. WHEN server errors happen THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
5. WHEN the system processes errors THEN it SHALL maintain error context and stack traces for development builds
