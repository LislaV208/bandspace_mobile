# BandSpace Mobile - Architecture Guidelines

## Architectural Philosophy
The project follows a feature-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns. Every architectural decision should be evaluated based on long-term maintainability, scalability, and technical debt implications.

## Core Architectural Principles

### System-Level Thinking
- Evaluate solutions for their impact on the entire system, not just immediate requirements
- Consider long-term consequences: scalability, maintenance costs, and testing complexity
- Question assumptions and challenge technology choices with "Why?" before implementation

### Trade-off Analysis
Every architectural decision involves trade-offs that must be explicitly acknowledged:
- **Performance vs. Cost**: Optimize where it matters, accept reasonable performance for reduced complexity
- **Speed of Development vs. Technical Debt**: Fast solutions today may require rewrites in 6 months
- **Flexibility vs. Simplicity**: Don't over-engineer for hypothetical future requirements

### Risk Identification
Actively identify and address architectural risks:
- **Single Points of Failure**: Ensure critical components have fallback mechanisms
- **Unnecessary Complexity**: Avoid solutions that introduce complexity without clear benefits
- **Maintenance Burden**: Consider how difficult the solution will be to modify and debug

## Flutter-Specific Architecture Guidelines

### State Management Strategy
- **BLoC/Cubit Pattern**: Use for complex state management with clear business logic
- **Provider**: For dependency injection and simple state sharing
- **Local State**: Use `StatefulWidget` for UI-only state that doesn't need to be shared

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Feature Modules**: Keep related functionality together in self-contained modules
- **Dependency Flow**: Maintain clear dependency direction (UI → Business Logic → Data)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each class should have a single, well-defined responsibility

### Performance Considerations
- **Widget Rebuilds**: Minimize unnecessary rebuilds through proper state management
- **Memory Management**: Be conscious of object lifecycle, especially for audio and media resources
- **Build Optimization**: Prefer `const` constructors and avoid expensive operations in `build` methods

## Development Quality Standards

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting with clear naming and structure
- **Testability**: Design for easy unit and widget testing
- **Maintainability**: Changes should be localized and not require extensive refactoring

### Technical Debt Management
- **Identify Debt Early**: Call out shortcuts and temporary solutions explicitly
- **Document Assumptions**: Make architectural assumptions explicit in code comments
- **Refactoring Strategy**: Plan for regular refactoring cycles to address accumulated debt

### Security Considerations
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data must use secure storage mechanisms
- **Authentication Flow**: Implement proper token management and refresh strategies
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and API responses

## Decision-Making Framework

### Technology Selection Criteria
1. **Problem Fit**: Does this technology solve the actual problem better than alternatives?
2. **Team Expertise**: Can the team effectively use and maintain this technology?
3. **Long-term Viability**: Is this technology stable and well-supported?
4. **Integration Complexity**: How well does it integrate with existing architecture?

### When to Reject Solutions
- **Hype-Driven Choices**: New technologies without clear benefits over proven alternatives
- **Over-Engineering**: Complex solutions for simple problems
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Solutions that create unnecessary dependencies
- **Performance Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before identifying actual bottlenecks

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Code Review Focus Areas
- **Architectural Consistency**: Does the code follow established patterns?
- **Error Handling**: Are edge cases and error conditions properly handled?
- **Resource Management**: Are resources (streams, controllers, etc.) properly disposed?
- **Business Logic Separation**: Is business logic properly separated from UI concerns?

### Documentation Requirements
- **Architectural Decisions**: Document why certain approaches were chosen
- **API Contracts**: Clear documentation of data models and service interfaces
- **Setup Instructions**: Environment setup and build process documentation
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Indicators
- **Build Times**: Monitor for increasing build complexity
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain meaningful test coverage for critical paths
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates with impact assessment
- **Performance Metrics**: Track app startup time, memory usage, and responsiveness

### Continuous Improvement
- **Regular Architecture Reviews**: Periodic assessment of architectural decisions
- **Refactoring Cycles**: Planned technical debt reduction
- **Technology Updates**: Evaluate and adopt beneficial new technologies
- **Team Learning**: Share architectural knowledge and best practices
