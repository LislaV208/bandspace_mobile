# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create core data models and repository extensions
  - Create `UpdateTrackData` model with validation for track title and BPM fields
  - Extend `ProjectsRepository` with track management methods (updateTrack, deleteTrack, getTrack, refreshTrack)
  - Write unit tests for the data model serialization and validation
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 3.4, 4.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement TrackDetailCubit and state management
  - Create `TrackDetailState` with loading, success, and error states for track operations
  - Implement `TrackDetailCubit` with methods for updating and deleting tracks
  - Add proper error handling and state transitions for all operations
  - Write unit tests for cubit state transitions and business logic
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 3.1, 3.5_

- [ ] 3. Create track management UI components
- [ ] 3.1 Implement ManageTracksButton widget
  - Create `ManageTracksButton` that displays management options in a bottom sheet
  - Integrate with `TrackDetailCubit` for state management
  - Reuse existing `OptionsBottomSheet` component following established UI patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3.2 Implement EditTrackDialog widget
  - Create edit dialog with form fields for track title and BPM
  - Add real-time validation for title (required) and BPM (optional, positive integer)
  - Handle form submission and integration with `TrackDetailCubit.updateTrack`
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.6, 4.2_

- [ ] 3.3 Implement DeleteTrackDialog widget
  - Create confirmation dialog showing track information before deletion
  - Handle delete confirmation and integration with `TrackDetailCubit.deleteTrack`
  - Display appropriate loading states during deletion process
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 4.1_

- [ ] 4. Integrate track management with track player
  - Add `ManageTracksButton` to the track player interface
  - Implement state synchronization between `TrackDetailCubit` and `TrackPlayerCubit`
  - Handle navigation and playback state when tracks are deleted or updated
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Write comprehensive tests for track management
  - Create widget tests for all UI components (ManageTracksButton, EditTrackDialog, DeleteTrackDialog)
  - Write integration tests for the complete edit and delete workflows
  - Test error handling scenarios and loading states
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Add proper error handling and user feedback
  - Implement user-friendly error messages for network and validation errors
  - Add loading indicators and disable buttons during operations
  - Handle edge cases like track not found or permission errors
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 4.4_
